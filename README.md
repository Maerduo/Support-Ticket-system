Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:


* [TinyMCE editor](https://www.tinymce.com/) - awesome web-based text editor
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) -The PHP Framework For Web Artisans
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [htmlpurifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.



### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd /home
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
$ git clone git clone https://github.com/ShaneCunn/Support-Ticket-system.git
$ cd Support-Ticket-system/Support
$ cp -r * /var/www/folder-to-be-installed-in
$ cd /var/www/folder-to-be-installed-in
$ composer install
$ composer dump-autoload
$ php artisan cache:clear
& cp .env.example .env
$ nano .env
```
# For Production
```sh
$ cd /home
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
$ git clone git clone https://github.com/ShaneCunn/Support-Ticket-system.git
$ cd Support-Ticket-system/Support
$ cp -r * /var/www/folder-to-be-installed-in
$ cd /var/www/folder-to-be-installed-in
$ composer install --no-dev
$ composer dump-autoload
$ php artisan cache:clear
& cp .env.example .env
$ nano .env
```
edit the .env with  database details
```
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret

BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
CACHE_DRIVER=file
SESSION_DRIVER=file
QUEUE_DRIVER=sync

REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379

MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null

PUSHER_APP_ID=
PUSHER_KEY=
PUSHER_SECRET=
```
As you can see, quite a lot of those values are empty. And, to be honest, by default you will actually need to change only a few of them â€“ related to database connection:
```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```
